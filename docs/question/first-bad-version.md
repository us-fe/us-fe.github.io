# first bad version

Say you have multiple versions of a program, write a program that will find and return the first bad revision given a `isBad(version)` function.

Versions after first bad version are supposed to be all bad versions.

_notes_

1.  Inputs are all non-negative integers
2.  if none found, return -1
